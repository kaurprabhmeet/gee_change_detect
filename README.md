**Google Earth Engine: Change Detection**

Calculating estimates of flooding extent over time in our study districts (Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Kurigram, Sirajganj). This work is largely based on an analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in [Google Earth Engine](#change_detection.js). This imagery processing methodology is adapted from guidance from the [UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal](https://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-flood-mapping/step-by-step).
